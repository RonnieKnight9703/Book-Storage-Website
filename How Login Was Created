For the login system we desided to utilize the software that was available on the hosting site that we used. It allowed registaration and the creation of a unique 
profile. With this we are able to control the fact that only registered members can add to the databse. 
The user information is stored in a different databse from the Book databse.

Joomla provides software where you can easily edit the different levels of users. As well as letting you edit the required information that is needed.
We aske for a username, real name, and a email. The software also lets you choose how the account is verified. It can be varified through email, phone (if we asked for
the number), or let it verify the account instantly. We decided to go ahead and allow instant verification for the purpose of this project.
