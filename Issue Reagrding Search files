Information regarding the search functions.
Though we created 3 different html forms we only have been able to work on a singular php form for search functions.
This is due to the fact that we wanted to get one of the search functions working before we moved to the next.

The goal was to acheive success with one and then just change the variables to better suit each unique search.
