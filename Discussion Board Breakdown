We decided to implement a plugin system known as Kunena. This essentially creates an enviroment where users can create topics and have discussions in a Reddit style experience.
The moderators will be able to watch over the discussions and respond to any reported comments as well as remove any offensive material.
Essentially a user creates a topic in the correct channel (moderators will move topic if it is wrong channel) and a discussion through comments can begin. Users
can quote other comments, give them likes, and even edit their own comments after posting.

This will give users the experience to have live conversations without having to wait for a moderator to approve any topic that is proposed for the website.
As well as promote a sense of community among the users.
